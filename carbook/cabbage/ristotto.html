                    <h2>Method:</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Sauté the aromatics:</strong> Heat olive oil and butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic. Sauté until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cook the mushrooms:</strong> Add the sliced mushrooms to the saucepan and cook until they are tender and have released their moisture, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Add the rice:</strong> Stir in the Arborio rice and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly, until the rice becomes translucent.</li>
                        <li><strong>Deglaze with wine:</strong> Pour in the white wine and cook until it is almost completely absorbed, about 1 minute.</li>
                        <li><strong>Add the broth:</strong> Gradually add the hot vegetable broth, 1 cup at a time, stirring constantly, allowing each addition to be absorbed before adding more. This process will take about 20-25 minutes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Stir in the cheese:</strong> Once the rice is cooked through and creamy, stir in the grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
                        <li><strong>Season and serve:</strong> Season with salt and black pepper to taste. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley and serve the Risotto ai Funghi immediately.</li>
                    </ol>
